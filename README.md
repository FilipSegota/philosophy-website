# PhilosophyWebsite

## Description
I created this website to be my philosophy portfolio (since I also have a degree in PhilosophyðŸ˜Š). I started it as a project for the web programming course I took, but I knew I would want to keep it for the future. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP (Not a lot of JS and PHP). Here are some of the components of the website:
  - 5 main HTML pages:
    - **Home** - index (welcoming) page
    - **Works** - this isn't actually a single page. This will include multiple "sub-pages". The idea is to have a "sub-page" for every major area of philosophy (Epistemology, Metaphysics, Historic philosophies, etc.)
      - Every "sub-page" will include multiple works/papers that can be accessed.
    - **References** - any references or acknowledgments
    - **About Me** - information about me
    - **Contact Me** - a page that includes a form to contact me and leave feedback, questions, comments, or concerns (Might change this and just put one type-feedback).
  - CSS for styling
  - A little bit of JavaScript for some functionality
  - A little bit of PHP to connect to the database of feedback (from the Contact Me page) (Might change this so I can just get them in email without storing them in the database, but I had to do PHP for the course). **NOTE:** PHP file and MySQL database are not on a server currently. I used XAMPP to host both locally and test them out and they are working as intended.
## Future Work
